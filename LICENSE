License for phy++ library and tools
===================================

Note: This covers all the files present in the 'include' and 'tools' directory
  (recursively).

List of dependencies licensed under the GPL:
  - The Gnu Scientific Library (GSL). Can be disabled by defining 'NO_GSL'.
  - The Fastest Fourrier Transform in the West (FFTW). Can be disabled by
    defining 'NO_FFTW'.

Note: If you enable the use of at least one of the above libraries, then you
  have to consider the whole phy++ library as licensed under the GPL. This means
  that your own code should also be publised under the GPL. Otherwise, the below
  license (MIT) applies to the phy++ library, and you are free to use any
  license for your own code.
